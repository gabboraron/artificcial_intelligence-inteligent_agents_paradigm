## What is AI
- those unknown pocesses with which our brains solve problems ~ Minskiy
- the definition change through the years, which makes it difficult to explain 

**roots of AI:**
- philosophy
  - how the world works
  - what we think about something 
- mathematics
  - formal logic
  - algorithms  -  
- psychology
  - behaviorism
  - cognitive science 
- neuroscience 
- economics
  - decision theory, utility theory 
  - game theory
- computer science *(1940- about this part of computing)*
  - efficient computer 
- linguistics
  - natural language processing

*The mind is something behind the machine*

If you look at the mind as a machine then you can replicate it. If you look the emotional beeing behind the mind then you will see emotions, feelings, free will, etc, and we can't replicate them.

1. Turing test
2. rational agent aproach
   - the agent is just something that acts
   - a rational agent acts like the best outcome

- view of intelligence
- collective behaviors
- agennt -oriented and emergent view of intelligence
  - autonoumus systems
  - agents situted in enviroment
